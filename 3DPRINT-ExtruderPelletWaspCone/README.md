### Troubleshooting

--

### Tools Needed

1. 3D PRINTER FDM machine
	* Work space of 200x200mmx200 minimum to print all parts. We used a Original PRUSA I3 printing all parts without support at 0.3mm layer height at 40% infill. PLA plastic is resistant enough but we will recommend to print in ABS or PETG( if you change the material the fittings might change)
2. Basic Screw drivers set (Philips,flat and allen keys for 2-6mm scresws)
